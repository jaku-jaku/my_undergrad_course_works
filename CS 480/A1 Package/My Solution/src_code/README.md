## Instruction
1. To run the code, simply run the '.ipynb' directly from this directory
2. You may see results in the end of each file.
3. Code bases are all in a flow of: "import libs" -> "import dataset" -> "define test environment/functions" -> "run env. with output results"
4. You may see all generated results from 'figs/...'
